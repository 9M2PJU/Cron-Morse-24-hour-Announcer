# Cron Morse 24 hour Announcer Docker

This project sets up a Docker container that runs a cron job every hour to play Morse code audio files using mpg123 and ALSA. The container is based on Alpine Linux.

## Features

- Runs a cron job every hour to execute a Morse code script.
- Uses mpg123 and ALSA for audio playback within the Docker container.
- Configurable time zone and audio device mappings.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/9M2PJU/Cron-Morse-24-hour-Announcer.git
   cd Cron-Morse-24-hour-Announcer
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**

   Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. Follow the installation instructions if needed.

3. **Build the Docker Image**

   Build the Docker image using Docker Compose:

   ```
   docker compose build
   ```

4. **Run the Container**

   Start the Docker container in detached mode:

   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. **Access the Container**

   To enter the container and inspect or debug:

   ```
   docker run -it --rm --device /dev/snd morse_cron /bin/sh
   ```

## Configuration

- **Time Zone**: The container uses the `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur` time zone. You can adjust the `TZ` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file if needed.
- **Audio Device**: ALSA sound device is mapped to the container. Ensure your host systemâ€™s sound device is accessible by Docker.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Verify that the `/start-cron.sh` script is present and executable.
- Check ALSA configuration on both the host and inside the container.
- Inspect container logs for errors:

  ```
  docker logs <container_id>
  ```
